## External Network Pentest
- Assessing an organization's security from the outside looking in
- Focuses on OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) gathering
    - OSINT in external penetration testing involves gathering publicly available information about a target system or organization.
    - It identifies potential attack vectors by analyzing data from sources like websites, social media, or public records.
    - OSINT helps map the target's infrastructure, such as IP addresses, domains, and employee details.
    - The collected data is used to find vulnerabilities without actively interacting with the target's network.
- ca. 32-40 hours "hacking"
- ca. 8-16 hours report writing


## External Network Pentest
- Assessing an organization's security from the inside of the network
    - You have already some kind of breached the security layer (e.g. fishing emails)
- Focuses on Active Directory attacks
    - Active Directory (AD) attacks target Microsoft's directory service, which manages user identities and permissions in a network. 
- ca. 32-40 hours "hacking"
- ca. 8-16 hours report writing


## Web Application Pentest
- Assessing an organization's web application security
- Focuses heavily on web-based attacks and the OWASP testing guidelines
- ca. 32-40 hours "hacking"
- ca. 8-16 hours report writing


## Wireless Pentest
- Assessing an organization's wireless network security (e.g. WLAN)
- Depends on wireless type being used (guest vs WPA2-PSK vs WPA2 Enterprise)
- ca. 4-8 hours "hacking"
- ca. 2-4 hours report writing


## Physical Pentest & Social Engineering
- Assessing an organization's physical security and/or end-user training
- Depends on tasks and goals
- ca. 16-40 hours "hacking"
- ca. 4-8 hours report writing

## Report Writing
- A report is typically delivered within a week after the engagement ends
- Report should highlight both non-technical and technical findings
- Recommendations should be clear to both executives and technical staff
