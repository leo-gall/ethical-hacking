## IP Addresses

> IP Addresses are _layer 3_ protocols.

- **IPv4:** e.g. 172.29.221.90 (decimal)
    - 32 bits (4 bytes) long
    - around 4 billion possible addresses
- **IPv6:** e.g. fe80::215:5dff:fe4b:c547 (hexa-decimal)
    - 128 bits (16 byte)
    - almost infinite possible addresses (around 38 zeroes)

> **Network Address Translation (NAT):** The reason why 4 billion addresses are currently sufficient is because of private IP address ranges which are assigned by routers or similar.

## Media-Access-Control Addresses (MAC)

> MAC Addresses are _layer 2_ protocols.

MAC addresses (physical addresses) are responsible for communication using network switches. They look like `00:15:5d:4b:c5:47`. The first three pairs are identifiers which you can lookup at [MA:CSV:en:do:rs](https://macvendors.com/), for example. These identifiers can be used to identify the manufacturer.
